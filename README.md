**IoT-Based ECG Monitoring for Fitness and Running Enthusiasts**  

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time heart monitoring system tailored for runners and fitness enthusiasts. Using the AD8232 ECG sensor and NodeMCU ESP8266, this IoT-powered solution captures ECG signals and uploads them to platforms like Ubidots for live tracking.  

Whether you're jogging in the park or pushing your limits in the gym, this system helps you monitor your heart's performance and ensures safety during physical activity. Accessible via smartphones or PCs, it provides an excellent tool for tracking fitness metrics and detecting potential heart issues in real-time.  

ðŸ“Œ **Key Features:**  
- Real-time ECG monitoring during physical activities.  
- IoT-enabled visualization on Ubidots for remote access.  
- Compact and portable design for convenience during workouts.  

ðŸŽ¯ **Perfect for:**  
Athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and developers looking to integrate health monitoring into sports technology.

### ðŸš§ **How to Build the System**  

1. **Components Needed:**  
   - AD8232 ECG sensor module  
   - NodeMCU ESP8266 board  
   - Jumper wires  
   - Breadboard  
   - Power source (e.g., USB power bank)  
   - ECG electrodes  

2. **Connections:**  
   - Connect the **AD8232 sensor** to the **NodeMCU ESP8266** as follows:  
     - `OUT` pin of AD8232 â†’ `A0` pin of NodeMCU (for analog signal input).  
     - `3.3V` and `GND` of AD8232 â†’ `3.3V` and `GND` of NodeMCU.  
     - Connect ECG electrodes to the AD8232 sensor according to the module's manual.  
   - Use jumper wires and a breadboard to set up the circuit.  

3. **Programming the NodeMCU:**  
   - Install the **Arduino IDE** and the ESP8266 library.  
   - Use the code provided [in this repository](#) to program the NodeMCU. The code includes setup for Wi-Fi connectivity and data upload to Ubidots.  

4. **Uploading Data to Ubidots:**  
   - Create an account on Ubidots.  
   - Set up a device and variable for receiving ECG data.  
   - Configure the API key and device details in the code.  

5. **Testing and Usage:**  
   - Power the system using a USB cable or power bank.  
   - Attach the ECG electrodes to the body (as recommended for sports activity monitoring).  
   - View real-time ECG data on the Ubidots dashboard.
